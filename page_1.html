				<h3>Phone/Tablet Blog Wireframes</h3>
				<img class="blog_image" src="images/wf_mob_tablet.jpg">
				<p>As my blog already has a relatively simple structure, it wasn't too difficult to make wireframes for a phone/tablet version. The main differences I have proposed are moving away from the nav bar, instead having buttons so things are easier to click. I've also moved everything to the top on the homepage so the user wouldn't need to scroll down when they arrive at the page.</p>

				<h3>The Value of Git for Designers Creating a Short-Notice Website Redesign Prototype</h3>
				<img class="blog_image" src="images/git.png">
				<p>Git is a version control system which tracks and stores the full history of a software project. Git has many helpful features that could assist a design team working on a short-notice website redesign prototype.</p>

				<p>The first valuable feature is the ability to “branch” off of a certain point. This feature allows a designer to work from one point and make as many changes as they like within their own branch, without disrupting the existing site. Many designers could branch off on their own and there would be no interference with anyone else’s work. When multiple people’s work does come back together, git can identify conflicting pieces of code and either resolve simpler things on its own, or provide an error message so people can correct the conflict. These features allow designers to have a divide and conquer approach, while still working as a team.</p>

				<p>Another valuable feature is the ability to view history and work from any previous version of the site. This would allow designers to iterate and explore different options while making the website, but they could easily revert to a previous version of the site if need be. This saves time and means there is less lost work.</p>

				<p>Another handy git feature that could be helpful for designers working in a team is the pull request review workflow. Pull requests allow everyone to review your code and discuss it before it is merged with other code/repositories. This makes it quick and easy for people to collaborate and discuss issues before it is finalised. Pull requests can also be used to simply start a conversation about a problem and it lets people overseeing a project keep track of changes. </p>

				<p>All of these features would allow a design team prototyping a website redesign to work both collaboratively and independently to achieve great results in a short amount of time. </p>
